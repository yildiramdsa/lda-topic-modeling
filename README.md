# LDA Topic Modeling

This project applies **Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA)** to extract topics from social media accounts. Using **natural language processing (NLP)** techniques, the text data is preprocessed, tokenized, and analyzed to identify key themes discussed by different accounts. The repository includes data preprocessing, LDA model training, topic evaluation, and visualization of results.
